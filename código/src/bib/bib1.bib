	Abstract = {Abstract Noise levels of common sources such as vehicles, whistles, sirens, car horns and crowd sounds are mixed in urban soundscapes. Nowadays, environmental acoustic analysis is performed based on mixture signals recorded by monitoring systems. These mixed signals make it difficult for individual analysis which is useful in taking actions to reduce and control environmental noise. This paper aims at separating, individually, the noise source from recorded mixtures in order to evaluate the noise level of each estimated source. A method based on blind deconvolution and blind source separation in the wavelet domain is proposed. This approach provides a basis to improve results obtained in monitoring and analysis of common noise sources in urban areas. The method validation is through experiments based on knowledge of the predominant noise sources in urban soundscapes. Actual recordings of common noise sources are used to acquire mixture signals using a microphone array in semi-controlled environments. The developed method has demonstrated great performance improvements in identification, analysis and evaluation of common urban sources. },

	Abstract = {Gestural Improvisation is a type of free improvisation that aims to create short and long-term relationships in the acoustic parameters of music, such as pitch and intensity. The gestural improvisation style is closely related to the concept of real-time composition. This work describes a set of experiments based on signal processing methods and machine learning techniques that are applied to gestural improvisation music. These methods are commonly applied to other styles of music and employed in music information retrieval and computational musicology, among other elds. As a case-study, a set of twenty-one multi-channel recordings of music performed by the ve- member gestural improvisation group EnsAmble Crumble is analyzed. <p> The theoretical framework presented includes a state-of-the-art scenario of computer improvisatory systems as part of an overview of musical concepts related to improvisation and structure. A section explaining the tools and technologies employed for analysis is given as a reference and a guide. The analyzed data is described in detail and a brief description of the author{\textquoteright}s previous experience in the development of gestural improvisation and improvisatory systems is also given. Finally, the results and conclusions of the analysis are presented with examples from the study the behavior of one instrument during the collective performance, the global interaction of one instrument across all of the recordings, and the interaction of all the members across all of the improvisations. </p> <p> In conclusion, basic rules of interaction were found that can be employed in the generation of computational models of musical improvisation. Such models may be integrated into virtual musical partners with a better musical intelligence than the systems currently available. A set of appendixes includes three articles that complement the work. The appendix contains the description of the Moz- Art-Global-Art project </p>},

Our interest lies in systems that can make contextual decisions based on the overall character of the sound field, as well as the specific shape and contour created by each player. We describe the history and paradigm of ‘expanded instrument’ systems, which has led to one instrumental system (GREIS) focused on manual sculpting of sound with machine assistance, and one improvising system (FILTER) which introduces the ability to listen, recognize and transform a performer’s sound in a contextually relevant fashion. We describe the different modules of these improvising performance systems, as well as specific musical performances as examples of their use. We also describe our free improvisation trio, in order to describe the musical context that situates and informs our research. },

  abstract  = {The past 30 years has seen a remarkable development in our understanding of how the auditory system - particularly the peripheral system - processes complex sounds. Perhaps the most significant has been our understanding of the mechanisms underlying auditory frequency selectivity and their importance for normal and impaired auditory processing. Physiologically vulnerable cochlear filtering can account for many aspects of our normal and impaired psychophysical frequency selectivity with important consequences for the perception of complex sounds. For normal hearing, remarkable mechanisms in the organ of Corti, involving enhancement of mechanical tuning (in mammals probably by feedback of electro-mechanically generated energy from the hair cells), produce exquisite tuning, reflected in the tuning properties of cochlear nerve fibres. Recent comparisons of physiological (cochlear nerve) and psychophysical frequency selectivity in the same species indicate that the ear's overall frequency selectivity can be accounted for by this cochlear filtering, at least in bandwidth terms. Because this cochlear filtering is physiologically vulnerable, it deteriorates in deleterious conditions of the cochlea - hypoxia, disease, drugs, noise overexposure, mechanical disturbance - and is reflected in impaired psychophysical frequency selectivity. This is a fundamental feature of sensorineural hearing loss of cochlear origin, and is of diagnostic value. This cochlear filtering, particularly as reflected in the temporal patterns of cochlear fibres to complex sounds, is remarkably robust over a wide range of stimulus levels. Furthermore, cochlear filtering properties are a prime determinant of the `place' and `time' coding of frequency at the cochlear nerve level, both of which appear to be involved in pitch perception. The problem of how the place and time coding of complex sounds is effected over the ear's remarkably wide dynamic range is briefly addressed. In the auditory brainstem, particularly the dorsal cochlear nucleus, are inhibitory mechanisms responsible for enhancing the spectral and temporal contrasts in complex sounds. These mechanisms are now being dissected neuropharmacologically. At the cortical level, mechanisms are evident that are capable of abstracting biologically relevant features of complex sounds. Fundamental studies of how the auditory system encodes and processes complex sounds are vital to promising recent applications in the diagnosis and rehabilitation of the hearing impaired.},

We posit that these structures are in fact emergent properties of the behavior of the factor oracle itself. An expert improviser (the first author) performed a series of improvisations with Mimi, a factor oracle-driven multimodal system for human-machine improvisation, and the formal structures of each performance was independently analyzed by the performer and an experienced music structure annotator (the second author). Quantitative assessment of the similarity between the performer's and the listener's analyses was carried out using techniques from the field of automatic structure analysis. Supported by a comparison to baseline analysis approaches, the results suggest a high level of agreement between the two sets of analyses. Drawing upon this foundation of evidence, we discuss these analyses and their relationship to common classical forms, including canon- and rondo-like forms, as well as forms based on the juxtaposition of rhythmic cells.},

  abstract  = {Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients are used as an abstract representation of the spectral envelope of a given signal. Although they have been shown to be a powerful descriptor for speech and music signals, more accurate and easily interpretable options can be devised. In this study, we present and evaluate the shape-based spectral contrast descriptor, which is build up from the previously proposed octave-based spectral contrast descriptor. We compare the three aforementioned descriptors with regard to their discriminative power and MP3 compression robustness. Discriminative power is evaluated within a prototypical
genre classification task. MP3 compression robustness is measured by determining the descriptor values{\textquoteright} change between different encodings. We show that the proposed shape-based spectral contrast descriptor yields a significant increase in accuracy, robustness, and applicability over the octave-based spectral contrast descriptor. Our results also corroborate initial findings regarding the accuracy improvement of the octave-based spectral contrast descriptor over Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients for the genre classification task.

  abstract = { This article presents Autocousmatic, an algorithmic system that creates electroacoustic art music using machine-listening processes within the design cycle. After surveying previous projects in automated mixing and algorithmic composition, the design and implementation of the current system is outlined. An iterative, automatic effects processing system is coupled to machine-listening components, including the assessment of the “worthiness” of intermediate files to continue to a final mixing stage. Generation of the formal structure of output pieces utilizes models derived from a small corpus of exemplar electroacoustic music, and a dynamic time-warping similarity-measure technique drawn from music information retrieval is employed to decide between candidate final mixes. Evaluation of Autocousmatic has involved three main components: the entry of its output works into composition competitions, the public release of the software with an associated questionnaire and sound examples on SoundCloud, and direct feedback from three highly experienced electroacoustic composers. The article concludes with a discussion of the current status of the system, with regards to ideas from the computational creativity literature, among other sources, and suggestions for future work that may advance the compositional ability of the system beyond its current level and towards human-like expertise. },

In this article, case studies are described where critics are derived from larger audio corpora. In the first scenario, the target music is electronic art music, and two corpuses are used to train model parameters and then compared with each other and against further controls in assessing novel electronic music composed by a separate program. In the second scenario, a ?real-world? application is described, where a ?jury? of three deliberately and individually biased algorithmic music critics judged the winner of a dubstep remix competition. The third scenario is a live tool for automated in-concert criticism, based on the limited situation of comparing an improvising pianists' playing to that of Keith Jarrett; the technology overlaps that described in the other systems, though now deployed in real time. Alongside description and analysis of these systems, the wider possibilities and implications are discussed.},

Features can be normalized/standardized, grouped by detected beat and onset locations as well as arbitrary imposed segmentations. Similarity matrices support multiple distance metrics, novelty curve calculation through checkerboard kernel, and dynamic time warping best match path discovery. Applications include automatic structure analysis of pieces, inter-piece comparison, and as a front-end to machine learning operations via SC classes or Weka.},
